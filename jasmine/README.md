# Jasmine

1. Jasmine is a Behaviour Driven Development testing framework for javascript.
2. it does not reply on browsers, DOM, or any javascript framework
3. Thus it's suited for websites, Node JS projects, or anywhere that javascript can run

###### simple example

```
describe("A suite", function() {
  it("contains spec with an expectation", function() {
    expect(true).toBe(true);
  });
});
```
